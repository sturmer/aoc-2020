## [1.1.0] - 2019-10-21

### Bug Fixes

- `c:new/2` was not using opts when `input` was a list
- project would not compile if `enforce: true` option was used on constructor.

### New Features

- `:check_keys` option is added. This will need to be set to `true` in order for
  keys to be enforced. It also will raise a `KeyError` if a key that's not part
  of a struct is passed as input to `new/1`.  Defaults to `false`, as I prefer
  to enforce these kinds of constraints through the use of `:constructor`
  functions instead of raising errors.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-08-13

First release! The API should remain stable from here on out.
